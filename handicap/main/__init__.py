# This empty file tells Python that this directory should be treated as a package.
# It is a convention to include an __init__.py file in a package directory.
# This file can be empty or can include package initialization code.
# In this case, we are leaving it empty.
# The presence of this file allows us to import modules from this directory as a package.
# This is useful for organizing related modules and making them easier to import.
# By including this file, we can use the following import statement in other modules:
# from handicap.main import some_module
# This allows us to access the functions and classes defined in some_module.py
# without having to specify the full path to the module.
# This is a common practice in Python programming to improve code organization and readability.
# The __init__.py file can also include package-level variables, functions, or classes
# that should be available when the package is imported.
# For example, we could include a package-level variable like this:
# package_name = "handicap"
# This variable would then be accessible as handicap.main.package_name
# when the package is imported.
# However, in this case, we are leaving the file empty to keep things simple.
# We can always add package-level code later if needed.
# Overall, this __init__.py file serves as a marker for the package and allows us
# to organize our code into a modular structure.
